""" (Whatâ€™s wrong with this code?) The following code should read an integer into the
variable rating:
rating = input('Enter an integer rating between 1 and 10') """

rating = input('Enter an integer rating between 1 and 10')

""" The above code can be casted on declaration 
    or casted at calculation
    
    to cast as the beginning of the code we can place the code
    input module into the int() module.

    module."""
